# The Great War
A ww1 themed strategy game on progress. Built using C++ and SDL2.0.
Created with Visual Studio 2019
C++ version: C++/11

Starting date: January 1st 1910
The world is in turmoil, tensions between the great powers of europe are rising.
The balkan Nation-states are in a state of constant war.
This might spark a greater conflict that will change europe forever.

"One day the great European War will come out of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans."
- Otto von Bismarck

In this time of crisis you take control over one of the following countries:
- The German Empire
- The British Empire
- The Austro-Hungarian Empire
- The French Republic
- The Russian Empire
- The Ottoman Empire
- The United States of America
- The Kingdom of Italy

The game is meant to be played in various ways.
A real life economy simulation is currently in progress.
The player will be producing different kinds of good
in order to sustain his Country's population and it's military.
Excess goods will be sold on the market with prices that will change
based on supply and demand.

The rest of the game mechanics are still not added to the game, but
the concepts are already drawn out. They will be implemented over time.

The game is stable at it's current state and there are 
no bugs that will cause a crash as far as I'm aware of.

This project requires the following libraries to be linked to it in order to compile.
- SDL 2.0.14
- SDL Mixer 2.0.4
- SDL Image 2.0.5
- SDL ttf 2.0.15
